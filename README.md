# Speech Denoising using DNN, CNN and RNN

This repository consists of application of Speech Denoising using DNN, CNN (1D and 2D) and RNN (LSTM) in tensorflow. I have uploaded the input audio files and also the output files from respective models. I was also able to achieve a Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) value above 10 dB in all the cases which indicates that the performance of the models was pretty good.
